# Weather Dashboard


## Description

This simple, browser-based Weather Dashboard allows the user to quickly view up-to-date current and 5-day forecast weather information for a given US city.

This project challenged me greatly to use and expand my proficiencies with API calls and the fetch JavaScript method, parsing and formatting JSON objects into useable data, event listeners, methods, DOM traversal syntax, Day.js date formatting, and browser localStorage functionality.



## Installation

To load and utilize this Weather Dashboard, simply visit the following URL from any contemporary web browser connected to the internet, and follow the prompts:

https://peejd.github.io/Weather_Dashboard/


## Usage

Upon visiting the landing page at the above URL, the user is presented with a single-page Weather Dashboard.

The user can then either enter a major US city into the text input field (city name only) and hit the "Search" button to return weather information for that city, or click on one of the buttons below the search box with preset cities to return weather data for those.

I ran out of time before I could get the LocalStorage working to populate these buttons with previously searched cities, but plan to submit as is for now and continue finishing that finalizing that functionality this week and re-submit the assignment.
